Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

brazil didnt win the world cup anymore :-(

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

i think from 10000 ongoing the difference is really insignificant
